# Jeopardy

Overview:

For this project, I created a game of Jeopardy.

Once a user comes to the site, they can select a point value from the categories shown.  Once clicked they will receive a question and 4 multiple choice answers to choose from.  They will then see their score rise (by the given point value) on the scoreboard.  Once all questions have been submitted the game is over and you will receive your final score.
